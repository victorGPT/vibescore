When cached input is present (e.g., Codex/Every Code), `billable_total_tokens` can be meaningfully lower than `total_tokens`, so the API ordering can rank models differently from what the user sees. Consider sorting by `billable_total_tokens` (with a fallback to `total_tokens`) so the list order matches the new billable totals. <details> <summary>ℹ️ About Codex in GitHub</summary> <br/> [Your team has set up Codex to review pull requests in this repo](http://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/general).

Added test: parseRolloutIncremental aggregates multiple models within the same hour. 2) Migrate v1 hourly buckets: normalizeHourlyState now migrates v1 buckets into v2 with model=unknown instead of resetting, preserving prior totals.

When cached input is present (e.g., Codex/Every Code), `billable_total_tokens` can be meaningfully lower than `total_tokens`, so the API ordering can rank models differently from what the user sees. Consider sorting by `billable_total_tokens` (with a fallback to `total_tokens`) so the list order matches the new billable totals. <details> <summary>ℹ️ About Codex in GitHub</summary> <br/> [Your team has set up Codex to review pull requests in this repo](http://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/general).
