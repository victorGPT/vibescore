# Verification Report

## Scope
- Claude SessionEnd hook install/uninstall.
- Claude JSONL usage parsing into half-hour buckets.

## Tests Run
- `node --test test/rollout-parser.test.js test/init-uninstall.test.js test/uploader.test.js`

## Results
- Passed.

## Evidence
- CLI tests passed with Claude hook and parser coverage.
- Parser test verifies `model` extraction and fallback to `unknown`.

## Remaining Risks
- Manual smoke (end a Claude session and confirm queue upload) not executed in this run.
